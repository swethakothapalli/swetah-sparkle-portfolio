# NLP for Customer Support

## Project Overview

This project involved developing a natural language processing (NLP) system to automatically analyze, categorize, and prioritize customer support tickets. The system efficiently processes thousands of daily customer messages, categorizes them by sentiment and urgency, and routes them to appropriate support teams.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**
   - Assembled a dataset of 50,000+ historical customer support interactions
   - Cleaned and normalized text data (removing special characters, standardizing formats)
   - Applied text preprocessing techniques (tokenization, lemmatization, stop word removal)
   - Created a balanced training dataset with manual annotations

2. **Model Development**
   - Fine-tuned BERT model for sentiment classification (positive, negative, neutral)
   - Developed a multi-class classifier for issue categorization (billing, technical, account, etc.)
   - Created an urgency detection algorithm based on semantic analysis
   - Built a ticket routing system based on classification outputs

3. **System Integration**
   - Developed a real-time processing pipeline for incoming support tickets
   - Created APIs for integration with existing customer support platform
   - Implemented feedback loops for continuous model improvement

## Results

The deployed NLP system achieved:
- 89% accuracy in sentiment classification
- 86% accuracy in issue categorization
- 40% reduction in average response time
- 35% increase in customer satisfaction scores

## Technical Implementation

The architecture consisted of:
- Fine-tuned BERT model using TensorFlow and Hugging Face Transformers
- Custom tokenization pipeline for processing customer messages
- Flask API for real-time inference
- Integration with existing ticketing system via webhooks
- Continuous monitoring and retraining pipeline

## Impact

The implementation transformed the customer support workflow:
- Support agents now focus on complex issues while simple ones are handled automatically
- Priority cases are identified and escalated immediately
- Customer satisfaction improved significantly due to faster response times
- Support team efficiency increased, allowing the company to handle 30% more tickets without additional staffing

## Technologies Used

- Python (NLTK, spaCy)
- TensorFlow and Keras
- BERT and Transformer architectures
- Flask for API development
- Docker for deployment
