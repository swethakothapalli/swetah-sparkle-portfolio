# Customer Segmentation Analysis

## Project Overview

This project involved analyzing customer purchase data for a retail company to identify distinct customer segments. By employing unsupervised machine learning techniques, we identified 5 distinct customer groups with unique purchasing behaviors and preferences.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**
   - Collected 3 years of transaction data from multiple stores
   - Performed feature engineering to extract meaningful customer attributes
   - Handled missing values and outliers using robust statistical techniques

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Analyzed purchasing patterns across different time periods
   - Identified correlations between customer attributes
   - Visualized spending distributions and frequency metrics

3. **Clustering Analysis**
   - Implemented K-means, DBSCAN, and Hierarchical clustering algorithms
   - Determined optimal number of clusters using silhouette scores and elbow method
   - Validated clusters through cross-validation techniques

4. **Segment Characterization**
   - Profiled each segment based on purchasing behavior, demographics, and preferences
   - Created detailed segment personas for marketing teams

## Results

The analysis revealed 5 distinct customer segments:

- **High-Value Loyalists**: Frequent shoppers with large basket sizes
- **Occasional Big Spenders**: Infrequent visits but large purchases
- **Regular Mainstream**: Consistent, moderate spending patterns
- **Price-Sensitive Newcomers**: Recent customers focused on promotions
- **At-Risk Former Regulars**: Previously active customers showing declining engagement

## Impact

By tailoring marketing strategies to each segment's unique characteristics, the company achieved:

- 30% increase in campaign response rates
- 22% improvement in customer retention among "At-Risk" segment
- 15% growth in average order value from "Occasional Big Spenders"

## Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- Clustering algorithms (K-means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical)
- Advanced data visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Statistical analysis tools
