# Predictive Sales Forecasting

## Project Overview

In this project, I developed an advanced time series forecasting system to predict monthly sales volumes for a retail chain with multiple product categories and locations. The model achieved 92% accuracy in predicting sales trends, allowing for optimized inventory management and improved cash flow.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection and Preparation**
   - Aggregated 5 years of historical sales data across 20+ store locations
   - Incorporated external factors like seasonality, holidays, and promotional events
   - Implemented data cleaning procedures to handle missing values and anomalies

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Created lag features to capture temporal dependencies
   - Developed calendar-based features for seasonal patterns
   - Engineered promotional impact indicators

3. **Model Development**
   - Implemented Facebook Prophet for baseline forecasting
   - Enhanced with SARIMA models for specific categories
   - Developed ensemble approach combining multiple forecasting methods
   - Fine-tuned hyperparameters using Bayesian optimization

4. **Validation and Testing**
   - Performed time-based cross-validation to assess model robustness
   - Calculated MAPE, MAE, and RMSE metrics for different forecasting horizons
   - Conducted sensitivity analysis to identify key influencing factors

## Results

The final forecasting system achieved:
- 92% accuracy for 3-month forecasts
- 88% accuracy for 6-month forecasts
- 82% accuracy for 12-month forecasts

Visualizations of actual vs. predicted sales showed strong alignment across different product categories and seasonal patterns.

## Business Impact

Implementation of the forecasting system led to:
- 18% reduction in excess inventory costs
- 25% decrease in stockout incidents
- Improved cash flow management through optimized purchasing
- Enhanced ability to plan promotional activities based on predicted demand

## Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Statsmodels)
- Facebook Prophet
- SARIMA/SARIMAX
- Feature engineering techniques
- Bayesian optimization libraries
