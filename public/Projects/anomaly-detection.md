# Real-time Anomaly Detection

## Project Overview

This project focused on developing a real-time anomaly detection system for IoT sensor data from manufacturing equipment. The system analyzes streams of sensor readings to identify unusual patterns that may indicate impending equipment failures, allowing for preventative maintenance before costly breakdowns occur.

## Methodology

1. **Data Infrastructure Setup**
   - Designed a streaming data architecture using Kafka for ingestion
   - Implemented a time-series database for efficient storage and retrieval
   - Created a real-time processing pipeline with Spark Streaming

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Extracted statistical features from sensor data streams (moving averages, variances, etc.)
   - Implemented signal processing techniques to identify frequency domain features
   - Developed correlation features between multiple sensors

3. **Anomaly Detection Models**
   - Deployed an ensemble of detection algorithms:
     - Statistical methods (Z-score, CUSUM)
     - Machine learning approaches (Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM)
     - Deep learning models (LSTM-Autoencoder)
   - Created a voting mechanism to reduce false positives

4. **Alerting and Visualization**
   - Developed a real-time dashboard for monitoring equipment health
   - Implemented tiered alerting system with severity classification
   - Created historical anomaly playback for training and analysis

## Results

The system successfully detected:
- 94% of equipment failures at least 24 hours before occurrence
- 87% reduction in false positive alerts compared to threshold-based systems
- Identification of subtle degradation patterns not visible to human operators

## Business Impact

Implementation resulted in:
- 62% reduction in unplanned downtime
- $1.2M annual savings in maintenance costs
- Extended equipment lifetime due to timely interventions
- Shift from reactive to predictive maintenance practices

## Technical Architecture

The system architecture includes:
- IoT sensors → Kafka → Spark Streaming → Anomaly Detection Models
- Time-series database for historical analysis
- Real-time dashboard for operations teams
- Alert management system with integration to maintenance workflows

## Technologies Used

- Apache Kafka for data streaming
- Apache Spark for real-time processing
- Python (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn)
- TensorFlow for deep learning models
- InfluxDB for time-series storage
- Grafana for visualization
